# 🧠 DP-100 Mini Projects — Azure ML Study & Deployment Toolkit

Welcome to the DP-100 Mini Projects repository! This repo is designed to support hands-on, reproducible learning for the **Azure Data Scientist Associate** certification, with a focus on **project-based mastery**, **Thai-English datasets**, and **deployment-ready workflows** for classroom and PD use.

---

## 📅 Weekly Schedule (Updated for April 2025)

### Week 1: Environment Setup & Workspace Design
**Focus**: Azure ML workspace, compute targets, datastores, Git integration  
**Mini Project**: 🔧 *Build Your Lab* — Deploy a reproducible ML workspace with Git-linked assets and compute targets.

Tasks:
- Create Azure ML workspace and link to GitHub
- Set up compute targets (CPU, GPU, Spark pool)
- Register datastore and upload sample datasets (e.g., Thai rainfall, NYC taxi)
- Configure environments with custom Conda dependencies

---

### Week 2: Data Exploration & Experimentation  
**Focus**: AutoML, notebooks, Synapse Spark, MLflow tracking  
**Mini Project**: 📊 *Sentiment Explorer* — Build and compare AutoML models for Thai/English review data.

Tasks:
- Use AutoML for tabular and NLP tasks (e.g., Thai restaurant reviews)
- Explore data using notebooks and Synapse Spark
- Retrieve features and track experiments with MLflow

---

### Week 3: Model Training, Pipelines & Deployment  
**Focus**: Custom training scripts, job config, pipelines, online/batch deployment  
**Mini Project**: 🚀 *Smart Deployment* — Train a model to predict school attendance trends and deploy endpoints.

Tasks:
- Write and run training scripts with parameterized inputs
- Build pipelines with custom components
- Deploy models to online and batch endpoints with logging

---

### Week 4: Language Model Optimization & RAG  
**Focus**: Prompt engineering, prompt flow SDK, RAG, fine-tuning  
**Mini Project**: 🧩 *Ask the Archive* — Build a RAG-based Q&A bot using Thai educational documents.

Tasks:
- Benchmark a language model from Azure AI Foundry
- Use prompt flow SDK to define chaining logic
- Embed data for RAG using Azure AI Search
- Fine-tune on Thai-English educational dataset

---

## 🧪 Bonus Week: Evaluation & Extension  
**Focus**: Responsible AI, model monitoring, classroom integration  
**Mini Project**: 🛡️ *Model in the Wild* — Monitor a deployed model and simulate real-world drift.

Tasks:
- Evaluate fairness and explainability with Responsible AI dashboard
- Set up model monitoring for endpoints
- Draft classroom activities using simplified project versions
