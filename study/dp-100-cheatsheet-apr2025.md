## 🛠 Core Azure ML Concepts

### Workspaces
- Central hub for ML assets (data, compute, models, endpoints).
- Linked to storage, key vault, app insights, container registry.

### Data Assets
- **Types**: `uri_file`, `uri_folder`, `mltable`
- **MLTable**: YAML + data files; schema supports `boolean`, `float`, `string`, `int`, `stream_info`.
- Register via SDK v2:
  ```python
  from azure.ai.ml.entities import Data
  from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes
  ml_client.data.create_or_update(Data(
      name="dataset_name",
      version="1",
      path="./folder_with_MLTable",
      type=AssetTypes.MLTABLE
  ))
  ```

### Compute Targets
- **Compute Instance**: Dev/test notebooks.
- **Compute Cluster**: Scalable training.
- **Inference Cluster**: Real‑time endpoints.

### Environments
- Conda/Docker definitions for reproducibility.
- Use curated envs or custom builds.

---

## 🧪 Experiments & Training

### Jobs
- **command job**: Custom scripts.
- **automl job**: Automated model selection/tuning.
- **pipeline job**: Multi‑step workflows.

### AutoML
- Supports classification, regression, forecasting, NLP, vision.
- Featurization settings:
  ```python
  featurization_settings={"datetime_columns": ["createdAt"]}
  ```

### Logging & Tracking
- `mlflow` for metrics, params, artifacts.
- View in Azure ML Studio → Jobs.

## 🤖 Generative AI (NEW in Apr 2025)
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**:
  - Provision Azure OpenAI resource.
  - Connect to Azure ML pipelines for prompt engineering & evaluation.
- **Fine‑tuning LLMs**:
  - Prepare training data in JSONL.
  - Use Azure ML jobs to fine‑tune and register models.
- **Vector Data & Embeddings**:
  - Generate embeddings for semantic search.
  - Store in vector databases (e.g., Azure AI Search).
- **Responsible AI for LLMs**:
  - Apply content filters.
  - Monitor for bias, toxicity, hallucinations.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Endpoints
- **Managed Online Endpoint**: Real‑time scoring.
- **Batch Endpoint**: Large‑scale offline scoring.

### Deployment Steps
1. Register model.
2. Create environment.
3. Deploy to endpoint.
4. Test with sample payload.

---

## ⚖ Responsible AI
- **Interpretability**: SHAP, feature importance.
- **Fairness**: Bias detection in predictions & LLM outputs.
- **Safety**: Content filtering for generative AI.
- **Privacy**: Mask PII, comply with regulations.

---

## 📅 Exam‑Day Tips
- Know **SDK v2 syntax** vs. CLI v2 commands.
- Understand **MLTable schema rules**.
- Be able to:
  - Create & register datasets.
  - Configure compute.
  - Run AutoML jobs.
  - Deploy & test endpoints.
  - Integrate Azure OpenAI into ML workflows.
- Expect scenario‑based questions mixing classic ML + LLM use cases.
